# Gilded Rose Kata (C#)

Based on the [Guilded Rose](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) kata by @TerryHughes and @NotMyself, this version of the exercise presents a set of failing Xunit tests. Start from the tests at the top and work your way down to capture all of the requirements.

Remember: Red-Green-Refactor. You would normally write the tests as you go, not all at once. To help simulate a TDD workflow, you should only consider one test at a time and not try to make multiple tests go green with one change.

If you like this exercise, also consider the [99 Bottles](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles) kata by @sandimetz and @kytrinyx.
